# Installation

### For UI testing installation requires both Robot Framework and Browser library powered by Playwright. 
1. Install [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst)
2. Install [Browser library](https://robotframework-browser.org/#installation)
3. Install RequestsLibrary: `pip install robotframework-requests`

### For API testing installation requires Robot Framework, [RequestsLibrary](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-requests), [JSONLibrary](https://github.com/robotframework-thailand/robotframework-jsonlibrary), [DatabaseLibrary](https://github.com/franz-see/Robotframework-Database-Library) and [PyMySQL](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL).
1. Install [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst)
2. Install RequestsLibrary: `pip install robotframework-requests`
3. Install JSONLibrary: `pip install -U robotframework-jsonlibrary`
4. Install DatabaseLibrary: `pip install -U robotframework-databaselibrary`
5. Install PyMySQL: `python3 -m pip install PyMySQL`
6. Import PyMySQL: `import pymysql` - if PyMySQL still doesn't work, you can use direct import command

### [Supported Browsers](https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html#SupportedBrowsers)
| Browser  	|Browser with this engine|
|:--- |:--- |
|chromium| 	Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (since 2020), Opera|
|firefox| 	Mozilla Firefox|
|webkit| 	Apple Safari, Mail, AppStore on MacOS and iOS|

### Run tests in chromium browser

`robot -v env:{ENVIRONMENT} -v browser:chromium {PATH}`

Since [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) comes with a pack of builtin binaries for all browsers, no additional drivers e.g. geckodriver are needed.

All these browsers that cover more than 85% of the world wide used browsers, can be tested on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Theres is not need for dedicated machines anymore.

## Example

### B2B

`robot -v env:b2b -v browser:chromium -d results tests/smoke/smoke_b2b.robot`

### B2C

`robot -v env:b2c -v browser:firefox -d results tests/smoke/smoke_b2c.robot`

## API

NOTE: the progress of the API automation can be found here https://spryker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PS/pages/3104834019/Robot+Framework+API+automation+progress.
If you are automating any endpoint, please mark it as WIP in this table, mark it as Done when finished.

Execute all tests in api folder (all API tests that exist).
`robot -v env:api_suite -d results -s api .`

Execute all tests in a specific folder (all API tests that exist inside the folder and sub-folders).
`robot -v env:api_suite -d results -s path.to.the.folder .`, example:  `robot -v env:api_b2b -d results -s b2b.glue.access_token_endpoints .`

Execute only positive tests in api folder (all positive API tests that exist, from all folders).
`robot -v env:api_suite -d results -s positive .`

Execute all positive and negative tests in tests/api/abstract_product_endpoints folder folder / test suite - tests in subfolder will be executed as well.
`robot -v env:api_suite -d results -s abstract_product_endpoint .`

Execute all positive and negative tests in tests/api/abstract_product_endpoints/abstract_products folder folder / test suite.
`robot -v env:api_suite -d results -s abstract_products .`

### Custom

`robot -v env:b2b -v browser:chromium -v headless:true -v host:https://www.de.b2b.demo-spryker.com/ -v zed_url:https://backoffice.de.b2b.demo-spryker.com/  -d results tests/smoke/smoke_b2b.robot`

`robot -v env:b2c -v browser:firefox -v headless:false -v host:https://www.de.b2c.demo-spryker.com/ -v zed_url:https://backoffice.de.b2c.demo-spryker.com/  -d results tests/smoke/smoke_b2c.robot`

## Automatically re-executing failed tests
There is often a need to re-execute a subset of tests, for example, after fixing a bug in the system under test or in the tests themselves. This can be accomplished by selecting test cases by names (--test and --suite options), tags (--include and --exclude), or by previous status (--rerunfailed or --rerunfailedsuites).

Combining re-execution results with the original results using the default combining outputs approach does not work too well. The main problem is that you get separate test suites and possibly already fixed failures are also shown. In this situation it is better to use --merge (-R) option to tell Rebot to merge the results instead. In practice this means that tests from the latter test runs replace tests in the original.
| Command  	|Description| 
|:--- |:--- |
|`robot -v env:b2c -d results tests/smoke/smoke_b2c.robot`|first execute all tests|
|`robot -v env:b2c --rerunfailed results/output.xml --output results/rerun.xml tests/smoke/smoke_b2c.robot`|then re-execute failing|
|`rebot --merge results/output.xml results/rerun.xml`| finally merge results|

The message of the merged tests contains a note that results have been replaced. The message also shows the old status and message of the test.

Merged results must always have same top-level test suite. Tests and suites in merged outputs that are not found from the original output are added into the resulting output.
 
## Viewing and Generating Keyword Documentation
Keywords used in the tests can and should be documented. If you add any new keyword into the files inside the 'common' folder, they should have [Documentation] tag in them that describes what the keyword does, what parameters mean and gives an example of the usage.

Documentation can be generated by these tags. For now only common_api.robot has documentation generated. If you added new keywords, you should re-generate the documentation and commit it together with the other changes you made.

To generate the documentation for api and bapi tests use this command:
`libdoc resources/common/common_api.robot API_Keyword_Documentation.html`

To view the documentation just open the generated html file in any browser.
